Description: Species sensitivity distributions are cumulative probability
    distributions which are fitted to toxicity concentrations for
    different species as described by Posthuma et al.(2001)
    <isbn:9781566705783>. The ssdtools package uses Maximum Likelihood to
    fit distributions such as the gamma, log-logistic, log-normal and
    log-normal log-normal mixture. Multiple distributions can be averaged
    using Akaike Information Criteria.  Confidence intervals on hazard
    concentrations and proportions are produced by bootstrapping.
